Write a program that given the numbers in the sequence searches concluded subsequence with maximum sum. 

The program should first read the length of the sequence (up to 1,000,000), then each number. 

Example: The contents of the input 

10 -50 30 -43 29 -21 -31 -33 6 35 -38 

that means it is in the sequence 10 numbers, thos numbers being the line -50, 30, -43, 29, -21, -31, -33, 6, 35, -38. 

The program should display the beginning of the index, the length and the sum sought subsequences. These numbers should
be separated by spaces and in the end new line.
